{- The Aura Monad. Functions of note:
pure    : yields a successful value.
failure : yields an error and bypasses all other operations.
catch   : catches an error.
wrap    : If given an Either, rewraps it into an Aura Monad.
(>>=)   : fails on the first error.
liftIO  : Perform intermittent IO using `liftIO`.
ask     : Obtain run-time settings.
runAura : Unwraps an Aura action. Must be passed `Settings` as well.
