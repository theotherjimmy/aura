{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}

{- Handles all `-M` operations for building from the ABS.

* On `-M` suboptions in general *
 Note that `-M` interacts with your _local_ copy of the
 Arch Build System Tree. `-i` `-p` or `-s` are thus _local_ searches
 of whatever you have in your /var/abs/
 If a package you're looking for isn't present in the local tree,
 nothing will show up, even if you know it otherwise exists in
 the repositories.

* On `-y` *
 Using `-My` makes an `abs` shell call on all the packages in your
 local tree. It does _not_ sync the entire ABS tree. For that, simply
 use `sudo abs`.

* On Building Packages *
 Using just `-M` to build a package from the ABS tree will attempt
 to build with the PKGBUILD from your local tree. If it doesn't
 exist, a fresh copy will be synced with `abs` and then built.
